# Federated_learning for anomaly detection on healthcare network traffic data - A snowflake integrated approach.

## Business Understanding:
The goal of this project was to explore the potential of Federated Learning (FL) for enhancing cybersecurity within the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) ecosystem. IoHT refers to a network of connected medical devices that collect, share, and analyze sensitive health data, which improves patient care but also introduces a significant vulnerability to cyberattacks. The specific challenge was to create a scalable and privacy-preserving framework that could detect anomalies—indicating potential cyber threats—without violating data privacy laws like GDPR and HIPAA. The reason for selecting this analysis was clear that healthcare is increasingly reliant on connected devices, but traditional security methods are becoming ineffective in protecting decentralized systems like IoHT. Federated Learning offers a way to address these challenges by allowing decentralized machine learning, enabling each device to locally train models while sharing only the parameters (not the raw data). I aimed to understand how this approach could be used to secure healthcare environments, particularly given the sensitive nature of healthcare data and the strict regulations in place.

One of the main challenges I faced was the heterogeneity of the devices and the data they generate. IoHT devices vary significantly in terms of their computational capabilities and the types of data they produce. Managing this variability while ensuring accurate and generalizable model performance was difficult. Another challenge was ensuring scalability while maintaining a high level of security—something I addressed by integrating the Snowflake cloud platform to manage model updates securely.

Through this project, I gained deeper insights into the balance between security, scalability, and privacy, particularly in a field as sensitive as healthcare. Despite the challenges, this project helped lay the groundwork for future research into how Federated Learning can be applied to various industries, not just healthcare, to address similar security concerns.


## Data Understanding

For this project, I used the ECU-IoHT dataset, which is specifically designed for analyzing cyberattacks in the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) environment. This dataset was chosen because it provides realistic network traffic data generated by connected medical devices, including both normal operations and various types of attacks. It contains key features such as protocols, packet lengths, source and destination addresses, and different types of cyberattacks like Nmap, DoS (Denial of Service), SMURF, and ARP Spoofing. I selected this dataset because it closely simulates the real-world environment in which IoHT devices operate, making it highly relevant for developing and testing the anomaly detection framework. The dataset’s structure allowed me to train local models on different devices, mimicking the distributed nature of healthcare IoT systems while maintaining privacy. Its variety of features also provided a rich set of attributes for identifying attack patterns.

One of the main challenges with the dataset was its heterogeneity, as each connected device in a healthcare system may generate data with slightly different structures. To manage this, I used stratified splitting to ensure that each subset of the data represented the distribution of attack types accurately, which helped prevent data imbalance from skewing model performance. I also applied feature selection and engineering techniques to focus on key features that contribute most to identifying attack types.
